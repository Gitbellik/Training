Whats that
Can't tell
Hand held dream
Shot in hell
Deep space ghetto (streets)
Show me somethin'
I ain't seen before
Mystery hind that
Death door
Juke step electrocute the floor
Whats the science on
Flyin' that high
Got a no-no goin', one time

Creeps up behind me
Over my shoulder
Turn around try to see
But its nowhere
Noided, noided
Static on my blindside

I seen footage, I stay noided I seen

Everybody's knowin'
Where ya think you're goin' ain't goin' nowhere
Satellite, handle that
Wit a lead pipe

Who captures life
Who takes whats left who stay
On that next, already know my gillicutti, like I told you
Don't touch me
Whats up wit it
I stay noided, stimulation overload account for it
Desensitized by the mass amounts of shit
